  ## Description
  The idea is to create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM following the MVC design pattern; using Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate HTML. The app is basically there to showcase the use of custom-made ORMs to access and manipulate data on a databse and use it to render elements dynamically on a web page per the request of the client.

  ## Installation

  This app is hosted on heroku using JAWSDB MySQL add-on which acts as an online host for its SQL database. You can access the app by clicking here: https://damp-springs-33070.herokuapp.com/.

  ## Usage

  The app has a list of pre-defined burgers in its databse that are ready to be dveoured. If you click on the devour button next to each item in that list, it will be moved to the lsit of devoured burgers on the right side of the page. You can also create new burgers by typing their names in the provided form on the page and clicking the submit button that will then adds them to the lest of burgers ready to be devoured on the left side of the page. Overall, the idea here is to show basic databse access and manipulation that takes place completely on the server-side and injecting the retrieved data into html using handlbars.
